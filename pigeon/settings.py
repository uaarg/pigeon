    Handling data structure changes here. That is, taking old style settings,

    requiring users to manually change or clear their settings. In
    order for this to work, a few rules need to be followed:

    1. Add an appropriate migration here anytime you change the
       default_settings_data in an incompatible fashion (ex. renaming
       a field).
    2. Don't remove any existing migrations.
    3. Add your migration to the end.
    4. Your migration shouldn't do anything if called a second time.

    Note that this doesn't handle users going backwards: using a newer
    settings file with an older version of Pigeon. They are on their
    own in this case (so should clear their settings if they run into
    any issues).
